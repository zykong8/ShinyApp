# When adding multimodal data to Seurat, it's okay to have duplicate feature names. Each set of modal data (eg. RNA, ADT, etc.) is stored in its own Assay object.
# One of these Assay objects is called the "default assay", meaning it's used for all analyses and visualization.
# To pull data from an assay that isn't the default, you can specify a key that's linked to an assay for feature pulling.
# To see all keys for all objects, use the Key function.
# Lastly, we observed poor enrichments for CCR5, CCR7, and CD10 - and therefore remove them from the matrix (optional)
cbmc.adt <- cbmc.adt[setdiff(x = rownames(x = cbmc.adt), y = c('CCR5', 'CCR7', 'CD10')), ]

# Seurat Standard Worflow

The standard Seurat workflow takes raw single-cell expression data and aims to find clusters within the data. For full details, please read our tutorial. This process consists of data normalization and variable feature selection, data scaling, a PCA on variable features, construction of a shared-nearest-neighbors graph, and clustering using a modularity optimizer. Finally, we use a t-SNE to visualize our clusters in a two-dimensional space.

```{r seurat-standard-workflow}
pbmc.counts <- Read10X(data.dir = "~/Downloads/pbmc3k/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/")
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.counts)
pbmc <- NormalizeData(object = pbmc)
pbmc <- FindVariableFeatures(object = pbmc)
pbmc <- ScaleData(object = pbmc)
pbmc <- RunPCA(object = pbmc)
pbmc <- FindNeighbors(object = pbmc)
pbmc <- FindClusters(object = pbmc)
pbmc <- RunTSNE(object = pbmc)
DimPlot(object = pbmc, reduction = 'tsne')
```

# `Seurat` Object Interaction

Since Seurat v3.0, weâ€™ve made improvements to the Seurat object, and added new methods for user interaction. We also introduce simple functions for common tasks, like subsetting and merging, that mirror standard R functions.

<!--With Seurat v3.0, the `Seurat` object has changed considerably. Interacting with the object has also changed, with new accessor and setter functions taking over the role of manually adding data by chaining `@` and `$` symbols. In addition, many former Seurat-specific functions have been deprecated in favor of using standard R generics, yielding a more native R experience when using Seurat.-->

```{r features-and-cells}
# Get cell and feature names, and total numbers
colnames(x = pbmc)
Cells(object = pbmc)
rownames(x = pbmc)
ncol(x = pbmc)
nrow(x = pbmc)
```

```{r idents}
# Get cell identity classes
Idents(object = pbmc)
levels(x = pbmc)

# Stash cell identity classes
pbmc[['old.ident']] <- Idents(object = pbmc)
pbmc <- StashIdent(object = pbmc, save.name = 'old.ident')

# Set identity classes
Idents(object = pbmc) <- 'CD4 T cells'
Idents(object = pbmc, cells = 1:10) <- 'CD4 T cells'

# Set identity classes to an existing column in meta data
Idents(object = pbmc, cells = 1:10) <- 'orig.ident'
Idents(object = pbmc) <- 'orig.ident'

# Rename identity classes
pbmc <- RenameIdents(object = pbmc, 'CD4 T cells' = 'T Helper cells')
```

```{r subsetting}
# Subset Seurat object based on identity class, also see ?SubsetData
subset(x = pbmc, idents = 'B cells')
subset(x = pbmc, idents = c('CD4 T cells', 'CD8 T cells'), invert = TRUE)

# Subset on the expression level of a gene/feature
subset(x = pbmc, subset = MS4A1 > 3)

# Subset on a combination of criteria
subset(x = pbmc, subset = MS4A1 > 3 & PC1 > 5)
subset(x = pbmc, subset = MS4A1 > 3, idents = 'B cells')

# Subset on a value in the object meta data
subset(x = pbmc, subset = orig.ident == "Replicate1")

# Downsample the number of cells per identity class
subset(x = pbmc, downsample = 100)
```

```{r merging, eval=FALSE}
# Merge two Seurat objects
merge(x = pbmc1, y = pbmc2)
# Merge more than two Seurat objects
merge(x = pbmc1, y = list(pbmc2, pbmc3))
```

# Data Access

Accessing data in Seurat is simple, using clearly defined accessors and setters to quickly find the data needed.

```{r metadata}
# View metadata data frame, stored in object@meta.data
pbmc[[]]

# Retrieve specific values from the metadata
pbmc$nCount_RNA
pbmc[[c('percent.mito', 'nFeature_RNA')]]

# Add metadata, see ?AddMetaData
random_group_labels <- sample(x = c('g1', 'g2'), size = ncol(x = pbmc), replace = TRUE)
pbmc$groups <- random_group_labels
```

```{r expression-matrices, eval=FALSE}
# Retrieve or set data in an expression matrix ('counts', 'data', and 'scale.data')
GetAssayData(object = pbmc, slot = 'counts')
pbmc <- SetAssayData(object = pbmc, slot = 'scale.data', new.data = new.data)
```

```{r embeddings-loadings}
# Get cell embeddings and feature loadings
Embeddings(object = pbmc, reduction = 'pca')
Loadings(object = pbmc, reduction = 'pca')
Loadings(object = pbmc, reduction = 'pca', projected = TRUE)
```

```{r fetchdata}
# FetchData can pull anything from expression matrices, cell embeddings, or metadata
FetchData(object = pbmc, vars = c('PC_1', 'percent.mito', 'MS4A1'))
```

# Visualization in Seurat

Seurat has a vast, ggplot2-based plotting library. All plotting functions will return a ggplot2 plot by default, allowing easy customization with ggplot2.

```{r visualization}

# Dimensional reduction plot for PCA or tSNE
DimPlot(object = pbmc, reduction = 'tsne')
DimPlot(object = pbmc, reduction = 'pca')

# Dimensional reduction plot, with cells colored by a quantitative feature
FeaturePlot(object = pbmc, features = "MS4A1")

# Scatter plot across single cells, replaces GenePlot
FeatureScatter(object = pbmc, feature1 = "MS4A1", feature2 = "PC_1")
FeatureScatter(object = pbmc, feature1 = "MS4A1", feature2 = "CD3D")

# Scatter plot across individual features, repleaces CellPlot
CellScatter(object = pbmc, cell1 = "AGTCTACTAGGGTG", cell2 = "CACAGATGGTTTCT")

VariableFeaturePlot(object = pbmc)

#Violin and Ridge plots
VlnPlot(object = pbmc, features = c("LYZ", "CCL5", "IL32"))
RidgePlot(object = pbmc, feature = c("LYZ", "CCL5", "IL32"))

# Heatmaps
DoHeatmap(object = pbmc,features = heatmap_markers)
DimHeatmap(object = pbmc,reduction = 'pca', cells = 200)

# New things to try! 
# Note that plotting functions now return ggplot2 objects, so you can add themes, titles, and options onto them
VlnPlot(object = pbmc, features = "MS4A1", split.by = "groups")
DotPlot(object = pbmc, features = c("LYZ", "CCL5", "IL32"), split.by = "groups")
FeaturePlot(object = pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "CD79A"), blend = TRUE)
DimPlot(object = pbmc) + DarkTheme()
DimPlot(object = pbmc) + labs(title = '2,700 PBMCs clustered using Seurat and viewed\non a two-dimensional tSNE')
```

Seurat provides many prebuilt themes that can be added to ggplot2 plots for quick customization

| Theme | Function |
| ----- | -------- |
| `DarkTheme` | Set a black background with white text |
| `FontSize` | Set font sizes for various elements of a plot |
| `NoAxes` | Remove axes and axis text |
| `NoLegend` | Remove all legend elements |
| `RestoreLegend` | Restores a legend after removal |
| `RotatedAxis` | Rotates x-axis labels |

```{r helper-functions}

# Plotting helper functions work with ggplot2-based scatter plots, such as DimPlot, FeaturePlot, CellScatter, and FeatureScatter
plot <- DimPlot(object = pbmc) + NoLegend()

# HoverLocator replaces the former `do.hover` argument
# It can also show extra data throught the `information` argument, designed to work smoothly with FetchData
HoverLocator(plot = plot, information = FetchData(object = pbmc, vars = c("ident", "PC_1", "nFeature_RNA")))

# FeatureLocator replaces the former `do.identify`
select.cells <- FeatureLocator(plot = plot)

# Label points on a ggplot object
LabelPoints(plot = plot, points = TopCells(object = pbmc[["pca"]]), repel = TRUE)
```

# Multi-Assay Features

With Seurat, you can easily switch between different assays at the single cell level (such as ADT counts from CITE-seq, or integrated/batch-corrected data). Most functions now take an assay parameter, but you can set a Default Assay to avoid repetitive statements.

```{r multi-assay}
cbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = cbmc.rna)
# Add ADT data
cbmc[['ADT']] <- CreateAssayObject(counts = cbmc.adt)
# Run analyses by specifying the assay to use
NormalizeData(object = cbmc, assay = 'RNA')
NormalizeData(object = cbmc, assay = 'ADT', method = 'CLR')

# Retrieve and set the default assay
DefaultAssay(object = cbmc)
DefaultAssay(object = cbmc) <- 'ADT'
DefaultAssay(object = cbmc)

# Pull feature expression from both assays by using keys
FetchData(object = cbmc, vars = c('rna_CD3E', 'adt_CD3'))

# Plot data from multiple assays using keys
FeatureScatter(object = cbmc, feature1 = "rna_CD3E", feature2 = "adt_CD3")
```
